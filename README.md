# Snake-Game

A version of the Snake Game made in Java. The GUI for the game was designed and implemented with Java Swing. The model-view-controller design pattern was utilized to design each aspect of the game.

The program can be run as is from the entry point in the SnakeMain.java file. This creates a Snake Game with a 10 by 10 grid. However, the user can choose the width and height of the grid by inputting two integers as command line arguments. The first number would be the width, and the second number would be the height.
